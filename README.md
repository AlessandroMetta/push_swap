# push_swap
This repo contains my work on the 42's project about the sorting of a stack. You can find more detail in the file subject.

After reading a lot on sorting algoritm and stacks, it seemed more natural sort the stack by intervals. So for the 100 number, 
I determine 3 ranges and for 500 number or more 6 ranges.

My project has not been rated yet, but reading the evaluation I find out that will not take the 100%.
