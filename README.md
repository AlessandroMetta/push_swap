# push_swap
This repo contains my work on the 42's project about the sorting of a stack. You can find more detail in the file subject.

After reading a lot on sorting algoritm and stacks, it seemed more natural sort the stack by ranges. So for the 100 number, 
I determine 3 ranges and for 500 number or more 6 ranges. I push the range of number that has to be sorted in the stack_b,
search for the smallest and the highest position and find out which one is better to be push back to stack_a, and do this for
all the ranges.

My project has not been rated yet, but reading the evaluation I think that will not take the 100%, due to the excessive number of moves.
